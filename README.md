# Description

This library performs two-dimensional modeling and inversion of seismic data using fourth-order summation-by-parts finite-difference operators on a regular grid. Three main configurations are available: acoustic (variable density), elastic isotropic, and elastic VTI. A limited fourth configuration is available for acoustic-elastic coupled medium with a flat interface.

The library includes several linear and non-linear solvers along with many options for full-waveform inversion FWI. The input and output data format is SEPlib. Nevertheless, a python script is provided to convert to/from SEPlib from/to numpy.
